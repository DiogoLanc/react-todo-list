# React To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list project built using **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.  
It was created to practice and apply React concepts such as:

- Component structure and reusability
- React Hooks 
- Conditional rendering
- Basic form validation
- API interaction 

At the moment, the project allows you to **add**, **edit**, and **delete** tasks.  
Data is fetched and updated using a mock API for demonstration purposes.
