# React To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list project built with **React** and **TypeScript**.  
It's meant to apply and practice core React concepts such as:

- Component structure and reusability
- Hooks
- Conditional rendering
- Basic form validation
- API interaction

At the moment the project allows you to add, edit, and delete tasks.  
Data is fetched and sent using a fake API for demonstration purposes.

Made for learning and practice.
