# React To-Do List

This is a simple to-do list project built using **Vite**, **React**, and **TypeScript**.  
It was created to practice and apply React concepts such as:

- Conditional rendering
- Basic form validation
- API interaction

## Some Features

- Add, edit, and delete tasks  
- Form validation (required fields and email format)  
- Loading and error UI messages  
- Data persistence with a local server using `json-server` ('db.json')

---

## How to run

```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm install

# 2. Run the mock backend (json-server)
npm run server

# Run the dev server (in a separate terminal)
npm run dev
